### Problem Statement

Walmart has collected data of internal and external factors of 45 store to determine their weekly sales. The data consists of Unemployment rate, CPI, markdowns, fuel rate, temperature, etc. The project starts with data preprocessing, cleaning, and data visualization. We will then make models based on Linear regression, Extra tree regression, Random forest regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Nearest Neighbor classifier, Decision Tree and XGBoosting to predict the weekly sales of the 45 departments. Finally, we will compare the accuracy of all the models to find the best performing model.
